🔹 PHYSICS
                                                                                                                                          1. What is Ohm’s Law? Write its formula.
 Ohm’s Law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided the temperature remains constant.
Formula: V = I × R
 (V = Voltage, I = Current, R = Resistance)

                                                                                                                                          2. Define power. How is it related to current and voltage?
 Power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or transferred.
Formula: P = V × I
 (P = Power, V = Voltage, I = Current)

                                                                                                                                          3. Draw a labeled diagram of a magnetic field around a current-carrying conductor.
 (As text:) Concentric circles around the conductor with direction shown by arrows (use the right-hand thumb rule).

                                                                                                                                          4. State the Right Hand Thumb Rule.
 If you hold a current-carrying conductor with your right hand such that the thumb points in the direction of current, then the curled fingers show the direction of the magnetic field.

                                                                                                                                          5. What is the difference between a concave and convex mirror?

                                                                                                                                             * Concave Mirror: Curved inward, converges light, used in torches, headlights.
